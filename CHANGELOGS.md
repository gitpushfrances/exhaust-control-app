## [0.6.1] - Phase 6 Patches & Background GPS

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED
**Date Completed:** March 5, 2026

### 🎯 What This Patch Achieved:
Removed Stats tab, rewrote restricted area creation with map-tap UI, fixed GPS to survive app backgrounding, fixed Firestore permission denial, fixed provider initialization bug that prevented areas from loading, and cleaned up animation render storm.

---

### ✅ Changes & Fixes

#### 1. Stats Tab Removed
- **File Modified:** `lib/screens/main_navigation_screen.dart`
- 4 tabs → 3 tabs: Home, Map, Profile
- `StatsScreen` import removed, indexes shifted (Profile: 3 → 2)

#### 2. Background GPS — Timer → Stream
- **File Modified:** `lib/screens/map_screen.dart`
- **Replaced:** `Timer.periodic` (dies when app backgrounds) with `Geolocator.getPositionStream()`
- Added `ForegroundNotificationConfig` — shows persistent "Location Active" notification required by Android to keep process alive
- Added `AndroidManifest.xml` permissions: `ACCESS_BACKGROUND_LOCATION`, `WAKE_LOCK`, `FOREGROUND_SERVICE`, `FOREGROUND_SERVICE_LOCATION`
- Registered `GeolocatorService` with `foregroundServiceType="location"`
- **File Modified:** `lib/utils/permission_handler.dart` — added background location request as step 3, strictly after foreground location granted

#### 3. Add Restricted Area — Full Rewrite (Map-Tap)
- **File Modified:** `lib/screens/add_restricted_area_screen.dart`
- **Removed:** Manual lat/lng/radius text fields
- **Added:** Tap map → red pin drops instantly → red circle preview renders → address auto-resolves in background
- Geocoding runs async with 8s timeout, falls back to raw coords on failure
- Name field auto-fills from barangay + municipality
- Radius picker: 50/100/200/300/500m buttons instead of text input
- On open, fetches real GPS and centers map there instead of hardcoded Manila coords
- `RestrictedArea` constructor corrected: `createdBy` + `createdAt` fields, removed wrong `userEmail` field
- Save button disabled until map point is tapped

#### 4. Address Format Upgrade
- **Files Modified:** `map_screen.dart`, `add_restricted_area_screen.dart`
- **Before:** Raw lat/lng coordinates displayed
- **After:** Street → Barangay → Municipality → Province → Region
- Example: `"Maharlika Highway, Brgy. Maybocog, Guiuan, Eastern Samar, Eastern Visayas"`

#### 5. Animation Render Storm — Fixed
- **Root cause:** `AnimationController` + `_mapController.move()` called on every animation tick → GPU frame overflow → device killed
- **Fix:** Removed `AnimationController`, `_latAnim`, `_lngAnim`, `SingleTickerProviderStateMixin` entirely from both `map_screen.dart` and `add_restricted_area_screen.dart`
- Replaced with direct `_mapController.move()` call — stable, no render storm

#### 6. Firestore — Database Created + Rules Fixed
- Created Firestore database (Standard edition, `asia-southeast1`, production mode)
- **Initial rules too strict** — only allowed `users/{userId}` path, blocked `restricted_areas` writes
- **Fixed rules:**
```
allow read, write: if request.auth != null;
```
- All authenticated users can read/write — appropriate for capstone scope

#### 7. Firestore — `isActive` Filter Bug Fixed
- **File Modified:** `lib/services/firestore_service.dart`
- **Bug:** `getRestrictedAreas()` and `streamRestrictedAreas()` filtered `.where('isActive', isEqualTo: true)` but saved documents never include `isActive` field → query returned empty list
- **Fix:** Removed `isActive` filter from both methods

#### 8. Provider Initialization Bug Fixed
- **File Modified:** `lib/screens/main_navigation_screen.dart`
- **Bug:** `RestrictedAreasProvider.initialize()` was never called — `_userEmail` stayed `null` so `loadRestrictedAreas()` returned immediately on every call
- **Fix:** Added `initState` with `addPostFrameCallback` to call `initialize()` with logged-in user's email after first frame
- Added imports: `provider`, `AuthProvider`, `RestrictedAreasProvider`

---

### 📦 AndroidManifest.xml Additions
```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_BACKGROUND_LOCATION" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WAKE_LOCK" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.FOREGROUND_SERVICE" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.FOREGROUND_SERVICE_LOCATION" />
```
Plus `GeolocatorService` service declaration with `foregroundServiceType="location"`.

---

### 🐛 Bugs Fixed (7 total)

1. ✅ **Background GPS dies** — Timer → getPositionStream + foreground service
2. ✅ **Animation render storm** — AnimationController removed entirely
3. ✅ **Firestore PERMISSION_DENIED** — Security rules too restrictive
4. ✅ **Areas never load** — `isActive` filter removed from Firestore query
5. ✅ **Provider never initialized** — `initialize()` added to `MainNavigationScreen.initState`
6. ✅ **Add area opens at wrong location** — fetches real GPS on init
7. ✅ **Add area hangs on tap** — geocoding moved to background async, pin drops instantly

---

### 📊 Testing Results
- Map-tap area creation → pin drops instantly ✅
- Address resolves in background ✅
- Area saves to Firestore ✅
- Red circle appears on map after save ✅
- Background GPS notification shows ✅
- 3-tab navigation working ✅

## [0.6.0] - Phase 5 & 6: GPS, Map Integration & Geocoding ⭐ NEW!

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED
**Date Completed:** February 17, 2026

### 🎯 What This Phase Achieved:
Replaced the static placeholder map with a fully functional OpenStreetMap integration using `flutter_map`. Implemented real-time GPS tracking that updates every 8 seconds, reverse geocoding for human-readable addresses, and live location syncing between the Map screen and Dashboard. Removed all hardcoded coordinates and static UI elements.

---

### ✅ Features Added

#### 1. Real OpenStreetMap Integration
- **File Modified:** `lib/screens/map_screen.dart`
- **Features:**
  - ✅ Full rewrite — placeholder grid/mock map removed entirely
  - ✅ Real OSM tiles via `TileLayer` with `flutter_map`
  - ✅ Pinch to zoom, drag to pan — native map controls
  - ✅ Zoom range: 5.0 (country) to 18.0 (street level)
  - ✅ `MapController` for programmatic map control
  - ✅ Center-on-user button snaps map back to current location
  - ✅ Restricted area circles drawn on map as red overlays
  - ✅ Motorcycle marker at user's real GPS position

#### 2. Real-Time GPS Tracking (8-Second Interval)
- **File Modified:** `lib/screens/map_screen.dart`
- **Features:**
  - ✅ `Geolocator.getCurrentPosition()` with `LocationAccuracy.high`
  - ✅ `Timer.periodic` updates every 8 seconds
  - ✅ Timer properly cancelled in `dispose()` — no memory leaks
  - ✅ Map auto-centers on first GPS fix only (user can pan freely after)
  - ✅ Marker moves to real position on every update
  - ✅ Graceful error handling — keeps last known position on failure

#### 3. Reverse Geocoding — Human-Readable Address
- **Package Added:** `geocoding: ^4.0.0`
- ✅ `placemarkFromCoordinates()` converts GPS coords to address
- ✅ Falls back to raw `lat, lng` string if geocoding fails
- ✅ Address pushed to `ExhaustProvider` via `updateLocation()`

#### 4. Live Location Sync to Dashboard
- ✅ Every GPS update calls `exhaustProvider.updateLocation()`
- ✅ `isInRestrictedArea` badge on dashboard updates in real time

---

### 📦 Packages Added
```yaml
flutter_map: ^8.2.2
latlong2: ^0.9.1
geocoding: ^4.0.0
```

## [0.4.0] - Phase 4: Bluetooth Hardware Integration

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED
**Date Completed:** February 17, 2026

### 🎯 What This Phase Achieved:
Replaced the entire mock Bluetooth implementation with real BLE scanning and connection using flutter_blue_plus. Fixed 6 critical bugs discovered during physical device testing including the splash screen never being shown, the connect button being non-functional, incorrect Android version detection, and scan triggering multiple times.

---

### ✅ Features Added

#### 1. Real BLE Device Scanning
- **File Modified:** `lib/providers/bluetooth_provider.dart`
- Full rewrite — all mock/simulated code removed
- Real BLE scanning via `FlutterBluePlus.startScan()` with 5s timeout
- RSSI signal strength converted to 0-100% scale
- Auto-disconnect detection via `connectionState` stream
- `stopScan()` called before every `startScan()` to prevent duplicates

#### 2. Real BLE Connection
- Real `device.connect()` with 10s timeout
- Stores `BluetoothDevice` object reference for later commands (Phase 7)
- Real `device.disconnect()` on logout/manual disconnect

#### 3. Connect Button Fix
- **File Modified:** `lib/widgets/bluetooth_connection_modal.dart`
- Connect button had empty `onPressed: () {}` — tapping did nothing
- Fixed to call real `connectToDevice()` and show result snackbar

---

### 🐛 Bugs Fixed (6 total)
1. ✅ Splash screen never shown
2. ✅ Route conflict (`'/'` → `'/auth'`)
3. ✅ Wrong Android version detection
4. ✅ Connect button broken (empty `onPressed`)
5. ✅ Multiple scan triggers
6. ✅ flutter_blue_plus v2 paid license — downgraded to `1.31.15`
