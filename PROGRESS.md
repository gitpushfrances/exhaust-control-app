## 📋 PHASE DETAILS

---

### ✅ PHASE 7.2: DEV TOOL RELOCATION + DASHBOARD CLEANUP (100% Complete)

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE — March 21, 2026

| Task | Status |
|------|--------|
| Add "Developer Tools" section to Super Admin profile | ✅ Done |
| Gate Developer Tools behind `normalizedRole == 'superadmin'` check | ✅ Done |
| Remove `_DevTestButton` widget call from rider dashboard | ✅ Done |

| Commit + push to main | ✅ Done |

> **Remark:** Phase 8 task 8.7 ("Remove `_DevTestButton` from production build") is now ✅ complete.
> The HC-05 test screen still exists at `lib/screens/test/bt_classic_test_screen.dart` and remains
> accessible exclusively through Super Admin → Profile → Developer Tools. It will be fully deleted
> at the end of Phase 8 after the automation is wired and validated.

### ✅ PHASE 7.1: HC-05 HARDWARE VALIDATION (100% Complete)

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE — March 19, 2026

| Task | Status |
|------|--------|
| Add `flutter_bluetooth_serial` package | ✅ Done |
| Fix `build.gradle` namespace AGP issue | ✅ Done |
| Create `bt_classic_test_screen.dart` | ✅ Done |
| Add dev test button to rider dashboard (temp) | ✅ Done → Removed in 0.7.2 |
| Configure HC-05 baud rate via AT commands (9600) | ✅ Done |
| Wire HC-05 TX→Pin6, RX→Pin7, Relay→Pin8 | ✅ Done |
| Validate Flutter → Arduino command receive | ✅ Done |

| Validate relay actuation on OPEN/CLOSE | ✅ Done |

#### Key Technical Details:
- **HC-05 baud:** 9600 (permanently set via AT+UART=9600,0,0)
- **SoftwareSerial pins:** RX=6, TX=7
- **Relay pin:** 8 — LOW=open, HIGH=closed
- **Command matching:** `indexOf()` — handles hidden `\r\n` from Flutter serial
- **Package fix:** Patched `flutter_bluetooth_serial` cache `build.gradle` — namespace + compileSdkVersion 34 + mavenCentral

### 🔜 NEXT PHASE — Phase 8: Core HC-05 Automation

**Status:** 🟡 UNBLOCKED — hardware validated, codebase clean, ready to wire

| Step | Task | Status |
|------|------|--------|
| 8.1 | Create `ClassicBluetoothService` — wraps HC-05 connection + send | ⏳ Next |
